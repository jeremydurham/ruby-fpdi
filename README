Ruby-FPDI

FPDI is a port of Setasign's FPDI PHP library to Ruby

FPDI is a library that allows inclusion and manipulation of existing PDFs
using the FPDI library.

A common scenario is that a designer gives you a PDF and tells you
to make a dynamically generated PDF look exactly like their design. 
This is a tedious task with most PDF libraries, because you need to
use basic shapes to build PDFs, and reproducing their complex design 
perfectly can be time intensive. With FPDI, the designer can build a
"template" and you can "write on" the template, preserving the initial
design and saving time. 
 
Pre-requisites

Requires FPDF for Ruby

Status

This code is currently pre-alpha and not ready to be used.

First passes of all of the FPDI libraries have been ported. Currently, I am
working on getting simple cases to work, squashing porting bugs as I find 
them, and once that is done I will start writing specs.
