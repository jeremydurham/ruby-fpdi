Ruby-FPDI

FPDI is a port of Setasign's FPDI PHP library to Ruby

FPDI is a library that allows inclusion and manipulation of existing PDFs
using the FPDI library.

A common scenario is that a designer gives you a PDF and tells you that
to make the dynamically generated PDF look exactly like their design. 
This is a tedious task with most PDF libraries, because you need to
use basic shapes to build PDFs, and reproducing their complex design 
perfectly can be time intensive. With FPDI, the designer can build a
"template" and you can "write on" the template, preserving the initial
designer and saving incredible amounts of time. 
 
Pre-requisites

Requires FPDF for Ruby

Status

First passes of most of the FPDI libraries (and dependent libraries) have been 
ported. There is one library left to port, testing to be done, bugs to squash, 
and then specs to be written.
